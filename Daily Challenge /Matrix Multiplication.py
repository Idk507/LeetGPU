"""
Write a program that multiplies two matrices of 32-bit floating point numbers on a GPU. Given matrix 
 of dimensions 
 and matrix 
 of dimensions 
, compute the product matrix 
, which will have dimensions 
. All matrices are stored in row-major format.

Implementation Requirements
Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
The solve function signature must remain unchanged
The final result must be stored in matrix C
Example 1:
Input:
Matrix 
 (
):
 
 
Matrix 
 (
):
 
 
Output:
Matrix 
 (
):
 
 

Example 2:
Input:
Matrix 
 (
):
 
 
Matrix 
 (
):
 
 
Output:
Matrix 
 (
):
 
 

Constraints
1 ≤ M, N, K ≤ 8192
Performance is measured with M = 8192, N = 6144, K = 4096
